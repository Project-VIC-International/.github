## Hi there üëã

Project VIC International is a non-profit 501(c)(3), EIN 83-0986212, nonprofit that builds and stewards technology to help law-enforcement identify, rescue, and protect children from sexual exploitation. We focus on tools, standards, and partnerships that make investigators faster, safer, and more effective‚ÄîVictims First.

Financial donations help us fund our mission to help enable thousands of law enforcement officers around the world who work each day to find and rescue children from sexual exploitation and abuse. 

Consider making a one-time or monthly [donation](https://secure.givelively.org/donate/project-vic-international-inc) to help us continue our mission.

## What we do

Enroll crimes against children investigators and digital forensics examiners into the [Project VIC hash intelligence ecosystem](https://www.projectvic.org/get-hashes). This is a key intelligence resource and it is FREE to sworn officers.
We work with [Kindred Tech](https://kindredtech.org/) to help digital forensics tool vendors license and adopt the [VICS Data Model](https://www.projectvic.org/vics-data-model) so their customers can leverage Project VIC hash intelligence.

We license [PhotoDNA](https://www.projectvic.org/photo-dna) to law enforcement agencies and digital forensics tool vendors. PhotoDNA is a key technology that helps investigators cluster visually similar images to reduce their exposure to child sexual abuse and exploitation material.

[GPUs for Good](https://www.gpusforgood.org) ‚Äî a new initiative started in 2025 that repurposes donated GPUs for accredited ICAC labs and digital forensics units to accelerate AI-assisted triage and analysis. GPUs are free upon request (pending availability) from an ICAC Investigator or supporting digital forensics examiner, or an ICAC Commander.

[VICSafer](https://www.projectvic.org/vicsafer) ‚Äî VICSafer is designed to analyze large volumes of unknown images and videos encounter in child sexual abuse investigations. The software is designed to help locate these files that have not yet been observed by law enforcement and recorded in a hash database.
VICSafer is free to law enforcement (via license) and available to corporate trust and safety team (via license for a fee).

[Illuminate](https://www.projectvic.org/illuminate) ‚Äî Illuminate helps investigators who are trying to identify unknown human created content (logos, writing, designs, etc). We have a Pocket Edition version of Illuminate that helps a local investigator identify unknown human created content to things within their local jurisdiction. 
This may help them determine if a victim is local. We are planning to release Illuminate 2.0 in 2026 which will be web-accessible and will handle a very large scale dataset of human created content.

[VICPoint](https://www.projectvic.org/vic-point) ‚Äî A system that processes file system tree from one or more endpoints to determine if the file path is indicitive of the presence of child sexual abuse and exploitation material.
VICPoint is free to law enforcement (via license) and available to corporate trust and safety teams (via license for a fee).

Standards & Ontologies ‚Äî contributions to CASE/UCO and domain extensions that enable interoperable evidence graphs.

Training & Community ‚Äî practical guides, workshops, and reference integrations across common DFIR tools.

Stakeholder Conduct
By participating, you agree to our [Code of Conduct](https://www.projectvic.org/code-of-conduct). We foster a respectful, trauma-informed space‚Äîespecially given our mission.

## üß™ Development principles

Lab-first: designs assume on-prem, air-gapped, or zero-egress environments.

Interoperability: schemas and APIs align with open standards (e.g.; VICS, CASE, UCO, CAC Ontology, gUFO, PROV-O) where practical.

Performance: GPU-accelerated where it meaningfully reduces time-to-insight.

Reproducibility: pinned deps, container recipes, and seedable simulators.

Explainability: preference for transparent heuristics and auditable ML.

Documentation: always provide detailed and easy to follow documementation for all projects.

Test Everything: our projects are used by law enforcement investigators, digital forensics examiners, and corporate investigators. They may need to testify to the use of our tools. All of our capabilities must be explainable and produce repeatable results.

## ü§ù Partner & ecosystem engagement

We collaborate with law-enforcement labs, academic groups, vendors, and open-source communities to reduce duplication and improve outcomes. If you represent an agency, university, or company and want to explore pilots or integrations, reach us at support@projectvic.zendesk.com.

## üîí Security & responsible disclosure

If you believe you‚Äôve found a vulnerability or a data-handling weakness:

Email support@projectvic.zendesk.com with details and reproduction steps.

Please do not open a public issue for security findings.

We‚Äôll acknowledge receipt within a reasonable timeframe and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline if needed.

## üìú Licensing

Code: we use Apache-2.0 for all of our open-source projects unless otherwise noted in the repo. We use custom commercial licenses for our non-public projects.

## üíù Support the mission

Spread the word: star repos, share issues that need eyes, and help improve docs

Every contribution‚Äîcode, docs, reviews, or hardware‚Äîhelps investigators save time and gets us closer to rescuing a child.

##üçø Fun fact

Many of us are DFIR nerds, computer and AI scientists, and former ICAC investigators. We do our best to stand on the shoulders of the giants that came before us to make the world a safer place for children.

## Thank you

For choosing to build with us‚Äîand for keeping victims at the center of this work.
