# Project VIC International

Uniting law‑enforcement, industry, researchers and technology to save children from sexual abuse. Victims First!

## 📚 About This Organization

Project VIC International (PVI) is a U.S. 501(c)(3) non‑profit charity whose technologies are trusted by thousands of investigators and digital forensics examiners in more than 90 countries. Our software, data standards, and operational expertise accelerate the identification of child‑exploitation victims and help with the prosecution of offenders.

This .github repository acts as the landing page for the Project VIC International organization on GitHub. Here you will find our mission, governance model, contribution guide, license overview, and key links that apply across every repository—public or private—under @ProjectVICInternational.

**Heads‑up**: All repositories formerly under the @VICSDATAMODEL organization are being migrated here. Please update your forks, remotes, and CI pipelines accordingly.

## 🎯 Mission & Values

**Victims First** – Every line of code and every data set exists to build investigative tools that shorten the time it takes to identify, locate and safeguard a child, and to help our partners keep children safe online.

**Global Collaboration** – We build open standards and interoperable tools so partners can work together seamlessly. You get all of the source code when you license our software. No black boxes.

**Privacy & Security** – Data is handled with the highest ethical and technical safeguards.

**Transparency & Trust** – Open‑source when we can, peer‑reviewed when we can't, always accountable.
